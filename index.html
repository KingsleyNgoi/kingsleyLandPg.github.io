        Content Delivery Network, CDN 
        * refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of    Internet content.
        * allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.
        * may also help protect websites against some common malicious attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks.
        * does not host content and can’t replace the need for proper web hosting, it does help cache content at the network edge, which improves website performance. 
        * By utilizing caching to reduce hosting bandwidth, helping to prevent interruptions in service, and improving security, CDNs are a popular choice to relieve some of the major pain points that come with traditional web hosting.

        [Bootstrap]
        * The Flex Container
            - its main-axis is the same as the block-axis. 
            - The main-start & main-end points 
              are the same as the before and after points of the writing-mode,
            - expands items to fill available free space or
              shrinks them to prevent overflow. 
            - Most importantly, the flexbox layout 
              is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts 
              (block is vertically-based & inline is horizontally-based).
            - .column-reverse behaves the same as column
              but the main-start & main-end are opposite to the content direction.

        * The Flexible Box Layout Module, d-flex 
            - is used for designing the flexible &
              responsive layout structure. 
            - the d-flex class is used to create a simple flexbox container.

        * Flex Column, flex-column
            - qickly manage the layout, alignment, & 
              sizing of grid columns, navigation, components, & 
              more with a full suite of responsive flexbox utilities. 
            - for more complex implementations, custom CSS may be necessary.

    <!--
        Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.
        * Grid Classes
            - xs (for phones)
            - sm (for tablets)
            - md (for desktops)
            - lg (for larger desktops)
            - xl (for extra large monitors)
            => col-lg- stands for column extra large    ≥ 1200px (max 1140px)
            => col-lg- stands for column large          ≥ 992px  (max 960px)
            => col-md- stands for column medium         ≥ 768px  (max 720px)
            => col-sm- stands for column small          ≥ 576px  (max 540px)
            => col-xs- stands for column extra small    < 576px  (none auto)
        * Grid System Rules
            - Rows must be placed within 
              a .container (fixed-width) 
              or .container-fluid (full-width) 
              for proper alignment and padding.
            - Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns
            - Content should be placed within columns, 
              and only columns may be immediate children of rows
            - Columns create gutters 
              (gaps between column content) via padding.
              That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column 
              via negative margin on .rows
            - Grid columns are created by 
              specifying the num of 12 available columns  wish to span.
            - Column widths are in percentage, 
              so are always fluid and  sized relative to their parent element.
        * No Gutters
            - Use the <div class="row row-no-gutters"> to 
              remove the gutters from a row and its columns:
        * Offset
            - .col-md-offset-* classes:
              increase the left margin of a column by * columns:
        * Push Pull
            - Change the order of the grid columns with
              .col-md-push-* and .col-md-pull-* classes
        * Examples (Mixed Stacking: Mobile, Tablet And Desktop)
            - get 3 columns starting at 
              mobile, tablets and scaling to large desktops 
              (these columns and their nested columns will stack)
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-xs-7 col-sm-6 col-lg-8">.col-xs-7 .col-sm-6 .col-lg-8</div>
                  <div class="col-xs-5 col-sm-6 col-lg-4">.col-xs-5 .col-sm-6 .col-lg-4</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-8 col-lg-10">.col-xs-6 .col-sm-8 .col-lg-10</div>
                  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4 col-lg-2">.col-xs-6 .col-sm-4 .col-lg-2</div>
                </div>
        * Spacing
            - Where property is one of:
                m - sets margin
                p - sets padding
                Where sides is one of:
                    t - sets margin-top or padding-top
                    b - sets margin-bottom or padding-bottom
                    l - sets margin-left or padding-left
                    r - sets margin-right or padding-right
                    x - sets both padding-left and padding-right or margin-left and margin-right
                    y - sets both padding-top and padding-bottom or margin-top and margin-bottom
                    blank - sets a margin or padding on all 4 sides of the element
                Where size is one of:
                    0 - sets margin or padding to 0
                    1 - sets margin or padding to .25rem (4px if font-size is 16px)
                    2 - sets margin or padding to .5rem (8px if font-size is 16px)
                    3 - sets margin or padding to 1rem (16px if font-size is 16px)
                    4 - sets margin or padding to 1.5rem (24px if font-size is 16px)
                    5 - sets margin or padding to 3rem (48px if font-size is 16px)
                    auto - sets margin to auto
                Note: margins can also be negative, by adding an "n" in front of size:
                    n1 - sets margin to -.25rem (-4px if font-size is 16px)
                    n2 - sets margin to -.5rem (-8px if font-size is 16px)
                    n3 - sets margin to -1rem (-16px if font-size is 16px)
                    n4 - sets margin to -1.5rem (-24px if font-size is 16px)
                    n5 - sets margin to -3rem (-48px if font-size is 16px)

                        * Button, btn btn-danger
                            - several predefined button styles, each serving its own semantic purpose,

                        * Button Toggle, data-bs-toggle
                            - Recommend using a button with the data-bs-target attribute.
                            - While not recommended from a semantic point of view, 
                                > can also use a link with the href attribute (and a role="button"). 
                            - In both cases, the data-bs-toggle="collapse" is required.

                            - Multiple <button> or <a> can show and hide an element

                            - The .btn classes are designed to be used with the <button> element.
